# DFT-digital-filtering-methods

This repository is a small project from the discipline Digital signal processing with the professor Ricardo Queiroz.

At this simple script, a music sample is filtered over 3 DFT filtering methods presented in the book Digital signal processing System analysis and design (Diniz P.S.R., et al.) with a low pass filter. The three methods are:

1. Convolution in the time domain
2. Overlap and add
3. Overlap and save

The output signals from each method is then plot and saved as a audio file to observe the practical result from the filtering and compare the similarity expected from each signal(since each method is a diffent approach to a DFT filtering)

Enjoy and have fun with the code! =D
